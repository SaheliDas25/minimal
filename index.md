### Document-Classification-with-CNN

here we have total of 20 types of documents(Text files) and total 18828 documents(text files).from document name, we can extract the label for that document.Now we need to classify all the documents into any one of the class.

### Donors-Choose-

The goal of the competition is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. DonorsChoose.org can then use this information to identify projects most likely to need further review before approval.

### EDA-on-Haberman-s-Survival-Data-Set


The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

this data set have 4 attribute mention bellow:

Age of patient at time of operation (numerical) Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical) Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical) Survival status (class attribute) 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer 2 = the patient died within 5 year objective:

objective is to predict whether the patient will survive after 5 years or not based upon the patientâ€™s age, year of treatment and the number of positive lymph nodes.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
